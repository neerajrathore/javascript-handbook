JavaScript callbacks are essential for handling asynchronous operations, enabling functions to execute after a task completes, such as loading data or responding to user actions. They help maintain non-blocking code, improving performance and responsiveness in applications.

A proposed solution for managing JavaScript callbacks is to use promises or async/await for cleaner and more readable code. These approaches simplify handling asynchronous tasks, reducing the complexity of nested callbacks (callback hell).

To implement this, replace callbacks with promises by returning a Promise object that resolves when an asynchronous task completes. Alternatively, use async/await syntax to write asynchronous code that looks synchronous, where await pauses execution until the promise resolves, making the flow easier to follow.

```
async function fetchData() {
  const data = await fetch(url);
  return data.json();
}
```
