# Debounced Search Example ðŸŽ¯

This project demonstrates a simple **debouncing** technique in JavaScript to optimize performance when handling frequent events, such as user input in a search field. Debouncing helps prevent multiple rapid function calls by delaying execution until the user has stopped interacting for a specified time.

## Features

A search input field where results are only displayed after the user stops typing for **300 milliseconds**.  
Styled using basic **CSS** for a clean and simple user interface.  
Easy-to-understand implementation of a reusable **debounce** function.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
3. Start typing in the search input to see the debounced results.
