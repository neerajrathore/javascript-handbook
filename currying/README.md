# Understanding Currying in JavaScript

This project demonstrates the concept of currying in JavaScript, its usefulness, and compares it with partial application. It also includes a simple functional discount calculator to show the real-world application of currying.

## Topics Covered:

- **Currying**: Breaking a function into smaller functions that take one argument at a time.
- **Partial Application**: Fixing some arguments of a function and returning a new function for the remaining arguments.
- **Real-World Example**: A functional discount calculator using currying.

## How to Run:

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Open the console (right-click > Inspect > Console) to see the demonstration.
3. Explore the JavaScript files in the `examples/` folder for more detailed examples.
