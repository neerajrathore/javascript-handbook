        <h1>Currying in JavaScript</h1>

        <h2>Why Is Currying in JavaScript Useful?</h2>
        <p>Currying helps make your functions more reusable by breaking them into smaller, more manageable pieces. This technique allows you to avoid passing all arguments at once and instead allows function composition.</p>

        <h2>Currying vs. Partial Application in JavaScript</h2>
        <p>Both currying and partial application allow you to pass arguments in steps, but they differ in their approach:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Currying</strong>: A curried function takes one argument at a time and returns a new function for the next argument.</li>
            <li><strong>Partial Application</strong>: Partial application pre-fixes some arguments of a function and returns a new function that takes the remaining arguments.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Example Project: Functional Discount Calculator</h2>
        <p>This project demonstrates the power of currying by using it to apply different discount rates on products using a curried discount function.</p>
