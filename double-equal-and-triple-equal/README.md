## Difference between `==` and `===`

In JavaScript, `==` and `===` are comparison operators, but they behave differently when comparing values. The primary difference is how they handle **type coercion**.

1. **Loose Equality (`==`) allows type conversion when comparing values of different types.**

    ```javascript
    let a = 5;
    let b = '5';
    console.log(a == b);  // true
    ```

    When using `==`, JavaScript converts the string `'5'` to the number `5` before comparing. This process is called type coercion, which results in `true`.

2. **Strict Equality (`===`) does not allow type conversion and requires both value and type to be identical.**

    ```javascript
    let x = 5;
    let y = '5';
    console.log(x === y);  // false
    ```

    Here, `===` compares both the value and the type. Since `x` is a number and `y` is a string, the result is `false` because the types don't match.

3. **Example Breakdown**:

    - **Loose Equality Example:**

        ```javascript
        let val1 = 0;
        let val2 = '0';
        console.log(val1 == val2);  // true
        ```

        In the case of `==`, JavaScript performs type conversion before comparing the values. Here, comparing `0` (a number) and `'0'` (a string) will return `true` because JavaScript converts the string `'0'` to the number `0` before the comparison.

    - **Strict Equality Example:**

        ```javascript
        let val1 = 0;
        let val2 = '0';
        console.log(val1 === val2);  // false
        ```

        However, with `===`, JavaScript does not perform type conversion. In this example, comparing `0` (a number) and `'0'` (a string) will return `false` because the types of the values are different.

4. **Key Difference**:

    - **Loose Equality:**

        ```javascript
        let a = null;
        let b = undefined;
        console.log(a == b);  // true
        ```

        `==` is less strict because it allows type coercion, meaning it tries to convert and compare values of different types. For instance, comparing `null` and `undefined` using `==` will return `true`.

    - **Strict Equality:**

        ```javascript
        let a = null;
        let b = undefined;
        console.log(a === b);  // false
        ```

        `===` is strict and does not perform type conversion, ensuring that both the value and the type are the same for the comparison to return `true`. In the above example, comparing `null` and `undefined` with `===` will return `false`.

5. **Best Practice**:

    ```javascript
    let a = '10';
    let b = 10;
    if (a === b) {
        console.log('Strict equality is true');
    } else {
        console.log('Strict equality is false');  // This will execute
    }
    ```

    It is generally recommended to use `===` over `==` in JavaScript to avoid unexpected results caused by type coercion. This makes your code more predictable and easier to debug.
